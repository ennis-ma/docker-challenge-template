# What I Learned and Discovered

These Docker projects helped me learn how to use containers in a real way. In Challenge 1, I figured out how to write Dockerfiles, build images, and use Nginx to show simple websites. Challenge 2 helped me understand Docker Compose better. I learned how to connect containers, set up Nginx to work as a reverse proxy, and fix problems. Now, I understand that Docker is a great tool for making applications that work the same way on different computers.
